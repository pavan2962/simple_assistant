The Wolfram Alpha Webservice API offers a web-based Application Programming Interface (API), allowing the computational and presentation skills of Wolfram Alpha to be integrated into enterprise, desktop, mobile, and web applications.

 Wolfram Alpha is an API that can calculate expert-level answers with the help of the algorithms, knowledgebase, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology of Wolfram which is made possible by the Wolfram Language.

Wolfram Alpha brings expert-level knowledge and capabilities to the broadest possible range of peopleâ€”spanning all professions and education levels.
It works  to accept completely free-form input, and to serve as a knowledge engine that generates powerful results and presents them with maximum clarity.
Energetically developed for more than a decade, Wolfram Alpha is an ambitious, long-term intellectual endeavour that  intends to deliver ever-increasing capabilities over the years to come.
With a world-class team and participation from top outside experts in countless fields, Wolfram |Alpha is constantly working to create what we hope will stand as a major milestone of twenty-first century intellectual achievement.
